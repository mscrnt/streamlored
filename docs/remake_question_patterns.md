# Common Remake Questions and How to Answer Them

## Overview

Chat loves asking about remakes. Some questions are genuine curiosity, some are wishful thinking, and some are the same question for the 500th time. Here's how to handle the common patterns.

## "When Is [Game] Getting a Remake?"

### What They're Really Asking
"Please tell me my favorite game is getting remade soon."

### How to Answer

**If there's actual news:**
Reference the announcement, release date, or development status.

**If there's no news:**
Be honest but not harsh. Something like:
- "No announcement yet. Given [reasons], it's [likely/unlikely] to happen."
- "Nothing official. It's been requested for years, but [publisher] hasn't shown interest."

**If it's extremely unlikely:**
Gently manage expectations:
- "Probably never, unfortunately. [Brief reason why.]"
- "The chances are low. [Publisher] has other priorities, and the original didn't sell well enough to justify the investment."

## "Why Did RE2 Get a Remake But Not [Other Game]?"

### What They're Really Asking
"It's unfair that popular things get more attention than my favorite niche thing."

### How to Answer

Explain the business logic without being condescending:

- **Sales matter:** "RE2 sold over 5 million copies. [Other game] sold maybe 500,000. Publishers remake guaranteed hits first."
- **Brand strength:** "Resident Evil is one of Capcom's biggest franchises. [Other game] doesn't have that built-in audience."
- **Engine reuse:** "Once you've built RE Engine and remade RE2, doing RE3 and RE4 is much cheaper. Starting fresh on a different franchise costs more."

## "Is Capcom Ever Going to Run Out of Remakes?"

### What They're Really Asking
Either "I'm tired of remakes" or "Will they eventually get to my favorite?"

### How to Answer

**For the skeptic:**
"They'll keep making them as long as they sell. And they sell. So probably not soon."

**For the hopeful:**
"They're working through the main RE titles first. After that, maybe Code Veronica or Dino Crisis if the numbers justify it. But 'maybe eventually' is the best anyone can promise."

## "Will There Ever Be a Dino Crisis Remake?"

### What They're Really Asking
"Please give me hope."

### How to Answer

This one comes up constantly. Be honest but not brutal:

- "Capcom knows fans want it. Whether they think it's worth the investment is another question."
- "It's more likely than something like Onimusha, but less likely than more Resident Evil. So... maybe? Eventually? Don't hold your breath."
- "The best case for it: RE Engine would work great for it, and Capcom likes money. The worst case: it never sold as well as RE, and they have limited dev capacity."

## "Why Don't They Just Remake Everything?"

### What They're Really Asking
"I don't understand game development economics."

### How to Answer

Without being snarky (save that for the persona):

- **Time and money:** "Each remake takes years and costs tens of millions of dollars. Studios can only do so many at once."
- **Opportunity cost:** "Every remake is a new game they're NOT making. They have to choose."
- **Diminishing returns:** "Not every old game has an audience big enough to justify the cost. Remakes of niche titles might not break even."

## "What About [Extremely Obscure PS1 Game]?"

### What They're Really Asking
"Validate my childhood."

### How to Answer

Be kind but realistic:

- "That's a deep cut. Unfortunately, games that obscure almost never get remakes. The audience is too small."
- "I love that game too, but it sold like 50,000 copies in 1998. No publisher is touching that."
- "Best bet is hoping for a fan remaster or modern port. An official remake? Basically zero chance."

## General Principles

### Be Honest
Don't give false hope. If something isn't happening, say so.

### Explain the Why
People accept bad news better when they understand the reasoning.

### Stay Playful
This is supposed to be fun. You can crush dreams while still being entertaining about it.

### Know What You Don't Know
If there's no information, say "no idea" rather than speculating wildly.

## Template Responses

### For Likely Remakes
"Yeah, [game] is probably on their list. [Publisher] has been hinting at it, and it makes business sense. No date yet, but it's reasonable to expect."

### For Unlikely Remakes
"Probably not happening. [Game] is beloved but niche, and [publisher] has bigger priorities. Never say never, but I wouldn't count on it."

### For Impossible Remakes
"That's never getting remade. [Rights issues / company doesn't exist / sold 12 copies]. Sorry. The original is the only version you're ever getting."

### For "Remake Fatigue" Comments
"They'll stop when we stop buying them. Take it up with everyone who preordered."
