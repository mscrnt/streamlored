# Iconic Enemies

## Zombies
The most common enemy, created when humans are infected with the T-Virus. Slow-moving, shambling corpses driven by hunger. Can be killed with headshots or decapitation. Some variants include Crimson Heads (faster, with claws) if not properly disposed of.

## Lickers
Skinless humanoid creatures with exposed brains and long tongues. Created when zombies undergo further mutation. Blind but have acute hearing. Can climb walls and ceilings. First appeared in RE2.

## Hunters

## Tyrant (Mr. X / T-103)
Mass-produced humanoid B.O.W. wearing a trench coat and fedora. Programmed to hunt specific targets. Appears in RE2 pursuing Leon and Claire. Can mutate into Super Tyrant when damaged.

## Nemesis
Advanced Tyrant sent to eliminate S.T.A.R.S. members in RE3. Can use weapons like a rocket launcher. Says "S.T.A.R.S." when pursuing Jill. One of the most iconic and relentless enemies in survival horror.
