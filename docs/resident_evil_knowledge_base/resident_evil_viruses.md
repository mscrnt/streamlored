# Viruses and Parasites

## T-Virus (Tyrant Virus)
The original virus created by Umbrella Corporation. Developed from the Progenitor Virus. Causes zombification in humans, turning them into shambling undead. Created B.O.W.s like Hunters, Lickers, and Tyrants. Responsible for the Raccoon City outbreak.

## G-Virus
Created by William Birkin, this virus causes extreme mutations rather than simple zombification. Infected hosts become grotesque creatures that continuously mutate. The G-embryo can be implanted in compatible hosts. William Birkin injected himself with it in RE2.

## T-Veronica Virus
Created by Alexia Ashford by combining the T-Virus with ancient queen ant genes. Requires 15 years of cryogenic sleep to properly bond with the host. Grants pyrokinetic abilities and insect-like transformations. Featured in Code: Veronica.

## Las Plagas
A parasitic organism rather than a virus, featured in RE4. Originally discovered in rural Spain. Hosts remain intelligent but are controlled by the dominant Plaga holder. Creates Ganados (villagers), Zealots, and other enemies. Saddler used it to control villagers.

## C-Virus
Featured in RE6. Combines T-Veronica and G-Virus. Creates J'avo enemies that mutate when damaged. Can create complete transformations called Chrysalids. Used by Neo-Umbrella terrorist organization.

## Mold (Mutamycete)
A fungal organism in RE7 and Village. Created by Mother Miranda using the Megamycete. Allows regeneration and mind control. The Baker family and Ethan Winters were infected with it.

## Uroboros
Albert Wesker's creation in RE5. Intended to "evolve" humanity by killing the weak. Only compatible with certain individuals; others become tentacled monstrosities. Named after the serpent eating its own tail.
