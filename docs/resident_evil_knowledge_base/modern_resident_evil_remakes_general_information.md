# Resident Evil Modern Remakes

## Overview

Capcom has been systematically remaking the classic Resident Evil games with modern technology and design. These remakes are generally well-received but each has its own strengths and controversies.

## The Remakes

### REmake (2002)
The GameCube remake of RE1 is technically the first modern remake, though it predates the RE Engine era. It's not just a visual upgrade – it adds new areas, new enemies (Crimson Heads, Lisa Trevor), new story content, and refined mechanics.

**What it modernized:** Graphics, content depth, difficulty options, additional modes.

**Fan reception:** Almost universally beloved. Considered superior to the original in every way. The standard by which RE remakes are judged.

### RE2 Remake (2019)
Complete rebuild of RE2 in RE Engine with over-the-shoulder camera, new controls, and reimagined level design. Leon and Claire's campaigns are separate but interconnected.

**What it modernized:**
- Third-person OTS camera replacing fixed angles
- Free aiming and modern movement
- Mr. X stalks you dynamically instead of scripted appearances
- Visual and audio overhaul
- Quality of life (auto-save, accessibility options)

**What fans love:** Gameplay feel, atmosphere, Mr. X intensity, visual fidelity.

**What fans criticize:** A/B scenarios are less differentiated than the original. Some areas simplified or cut.

### RE3 Remake (2020)
Rebuild of RE3 with similar treatment to RE2R. Jill escapes Raccoon City while hunted by Nemesis.

**What it modernized:** Same OTS engine/controls as RE2R. Nemesis reimagined with more dramatic transformations. Added dodge mechanic.

**What fans love:** Core gameplay is solid. Some sequences are spectacular.

**What fans criticize:** Significant content cuts – the clock tower is basically removed, Nemesis is less dynamic than expected, game is short. Many feel it should have been DLC for RE2R rather than full price.

### RE4 Remake (2023)
Reimagining of the action-horror classic. Leon rescues Ashley from a cult in rural Spain.

**What it modernized:**
- Updated controls and movement
- Parry system for knife combat
- Ashley AI dramatically improved
- Darker, more serious tone than the campy original
- Side content like Separate Ways DLC

**What fans love:** Gameplay is excellent, looks incredible, respects the original while changing enough to feel fresh.

**What fans criticize:** Some fans miss the original's campy tone. A few areas/enemies cut or changed. Island section divisive.

## Why These Got Remade

### Sales History
RE2 sold over 5 million copies. RE4 sold over 10 million. These are proven hits with built-in audiences.

### RE Engine Investment
Once Capcom built RE Engine, reusing it for remakes is cost-effective. The tech already exists; you're primarily doing art, design, and writing.

### Brand Maintenance
Regular RE releases keep the franchise relevant. Remakes fill gaps between new entries and bring classic games to new audiences.

### Low Risk, High Return
Remakes have known quantities – proven designs, existing fans, established stories. Compared to new IP, the risk is minimal.

## Why Not Everything Gets Remade

### Diminishing Returns
Each remake takes years. Capcom can't remake everything, and they'll prioritize the biggest sellers first.

### Code Veronica's Position
CV sold less than RE2/3/4 and has a reputation for being difficult and long. It's on the maybe list, but it's not guaranteed.

### RE0's Awkward Design
Zero's partner system and no-item-boxes are divisive. Remaking it means either preserving mechanics fans dislike or changing them and making it "not really RE0."

### New Games Still Matter
Capcom also needs to make RE9, RE10, etc. Remakes can't be the entire franchise output.

## Remake Quality Spectrum

**Gold standard:** REmake, RE2 Remake, RE4 Remake – faithful but improved.

**Controversial:** RE3 Remake – good gameplay but too much cut content.

**Future concerns:** Will Code Veronica or RE0 get the RE3R treatment (rushed, cut) or the RE2R treatment (thorough, expanded)?
