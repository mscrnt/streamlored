# Resident Evil 1 Remake General Information

This document contains general information, trivia, and common questions related to the 2002 remake of *Resident Evil* for the Nintendo GameCube, often called *REmake*.

## Alternative Titles & Nicknames

To avoid confusion with the 1996 original, the community refers to this game by several names:

- **REmake**: The most common nickname.
- **RE1 Remake**: Clear and descriptive.
- **Resident Evil (2002)**: To distinguish it by its release year.
- **The HD Remaster**: A common name for the modern version.

## Distinction from Resident Evil HD Remaster

There should be a distinction made between *RE1 Remake* and *Resident Evil HD Remaster*.

*Resident Evil HD Remaster* is a remaster of the *RE1 Remake*. The original remake was released on the Gamecube in 2002 and the Wii in 2009.

They are functionally the same game, but *Resident Evil HD Remaster* is a *REMASTER* of the RE1 Remake, released on the PS3, PS4, PS5, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, Switch, Switch 2, and PC (Steam). It has some pretty big Quality of Life changes. People usually call it "the HD remaster" to differentiate it from the original GCN and Wii releases. Other HD Remasters for other Resident Evil games exist, so please derive proper context when trying to determine which HD Remaster a viewer may be talking about or referring to.

## Key Differences from the 1996 Original

REmake is a significant overhaul, not just a remaster. Key changes include:

### Crimson Heads
- **Mechanic**: Zombies that are not properly disposed of (by burning the corpse or destroying the head) will reanimate as Crimson Heads.
- **Attributes**: Faster, more aggressive, and more dangerous than standard zombies. They have sharp claws and a distinctive red appearance.
- **Impact**: This adds a strategic layer to gameplay, forcing players to manage limited kerosene fuel or aim for headshots, which is more difficult with the classic tank controls.

### New Areas
The Spencer Mansion and its surroundings were expanded with entirely new locations not present in the original game, including:
- A new graveyard area.
- A cabin in the woods where you encounter Lisa Trevor.
- An expanded network of underground tunnels.

### Lisa Trevor
- **Character**: A new, tragic, and formidable enemy who relentlessly stalks the player.
- **Lore**: Lisa Trevor's story is a key addition to the game's lore, connecting directly to the origins of the Progenitor virus and the founding of the Umbrella Corporation. She is an immortal, mutated creature that cannot be killed by conventional means.

### Defensive Items
Players can now find and equip defensive items to escape an enemy's grasp, preventing damage. These are single-use and character-dependent:
- **Jill**: Taser
- **Chris**: Stun Grenades
- **Both**: Daggers
Using a defensive item saves you from a bite but costs a resource.

## Common Questions

### Is this the best game to start the series with?
For newcomers, Resident Evil 1 Remake is often considered an excellent starting point. It establishes the tone, lore, and classic survival horror mechanics that define the series. Its high-quality presentation has aged well, making it more approachable than the 1996 original.

### How do you kill a Crimson Head?
Once a zombie becomes a Crimson Head, it can be killed with standard weapons. The key is to prevent them from turning in the first place by burning the bodies of downed zombies using the Kerosene and Lighter or by destroying their heads with a powerful weapon like the shotgun or magnum.
