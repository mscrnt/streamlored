# Resident Evil HD Remaster - Jill Normal Mode Bad Ending (any%) Speedrun Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the Jill Normal Mode Bad Ending (any%) route for Resident Evil HD Remaster on Steam. This run is played on "Out of the Box" game settings. The bad ending requires: not rescuing Chris from his cell, Barry dying earlier in the game, and the mansion not being destroyed.

**Category**: Any% Bad Ending
**Character**: Jill Valentine
**Platform**: Steam

**Key Route Characteristics for Bad Ending any%:**
- Say NO to Barry in caves (causes his death, and you pick up Barry's .44 Magnum)
- Don't rescue Chris from lab cell (avoid picking up MO Discs)
- More aggressive/optimized routing with a very direct route toward the end.
- No usage of Rocket Launcher or Samurai Edge.
- Saving Richard does NOT trigger the bad ending. It will trigger other events, but it does NOT cause the bad ending.
- Bad Ending is not a requirement for any%. It is merely the fastest ending to get.

**Characteristics of speedrunning Resident Evil HD Remaster on PC**
- In the game's settings, your framerate is set to "variable", and the Vsync option is set to "off". This makes the game run at a maximum of 120 Frames Per Second ("FPS"). 120FPS causes the game to run at its maximum speed.
- any% in the context of Resident Evil REmake speedruns (all platforms) means "any ending", but it is intended for the player to run Bad Ending, as it is the fastest.
- for any% runs, Rocket Launcher is banned unless you are running the New Game + category

**Characteristics unique to playing Jill Valentine**
- Jill has 960 HP, or "hit points". This is her health. If she is above 75% health, she is in "Fine" Status. If she has between 50% and 75% health, she is in "Yellow Caution" status. If she is between 25% and 50% HP, she is in "Orange Caution" status. If she has only 25% damage left, she is in "Danger" status.
- Jill has a maximum of 8 item slots. Chris has a maximum of 6.
- Jill gets a permanent Lockpick from Barry in the main hall at the beginning of the game. Chris gets a permanent Lighter in his inventory, instead.
- Jill will find a Grenade Launcher. Chris will find a Flamethrower, instead, but he doesn't get the Flamethrower for the whole game.

**About the Livesplit Autosplitter**
- Resident Evil HD Remaster speedruns on PC/Steam are timed via an Autosplitter Script (.asl file) in Livesplit. This Autosplitter Script automatically hits the splits so the player doesn't have to worry about manually hitting the button each time a split is completed.
- Carci's splits are "door splits", meaning the autosplitter will automatically split each time Carci opens a door, with the exception of a few doors (if necessary, will define later). With each new room load, a new split begins.
- Resident Evil HD Remaster speedruns on PC/Steam are timed via LRT, or "Load Removal Time". This is a timing method that uses the .asl script. The .asl script times the speedrun via "RTA" or "Real Time Attack" timing. This is different from Resident Evil HD Remaster's internal game timer, in that it uses "Real Time" instead.
- LRT pauses the timer on each door load, freezing the timer during loading screens. This is done to make timing more fair between PC setups, as each runner's computer hardware is different.

## Mansion 1

### Unequip Handgun

Open inventory immediately and unequip the handgun. Unequipping your handgun saves time since you'll be running past most of the enemies in the game.

### Wesker Dialogue

Mash through Wesker's dialogue in the main hall.

### Cold Feet (Emblem)

Check the double-doors again. This will initiate a cutscene where Barry asks Jill if she has "cold feet". Skip it. Now run to Barry and skip the "blood" cutscene. Do not pick up the Emblem, as this makes it more difficult to move the menu cursor quickly for most times you have to use items during Mansion 1. Now pass by the door where you would normally go through to find the zombie eating Kenneth, and try to go back to the main hall. An alternate cutscene will play where the aformentioned zombie comes out of the door.

### Main Hall Stairskate

After cutscenes, execute stairskate on main hall stairs going up then back down. Input: hold "up" on D-pad + mash run while approaching stairs. Mash past the following cutscene to get the Lockpick (Jill-Only Item).

### to Kenneth Hall

Head through the dining room into the door to the Kenneth Hallway.

### to West Stairwell

Head through the door next to Kenneth, into the West Stairwell 1. There are 5 total doors in the Kenneth Hallway, which will be defined later.

### West Stairwell Stairskate

Stairskate up the west stairwell. Open the door to the Arrow Hallway, or "Murder Hall".

### !!HALLWAY HUMPIST!!

This hallway is known colloquially by runners as the "Murder hall". It is the hallway where you pick up the Golden Arrow. There are two active zombies in this room, and one zombie that becomes a Crimson Head later. There are 5 doors. The one directly infront is unlocked, which leads to the Armor Trap. We can't go there yet. The next door is locked, and leads to West Stairwell 2. Immediately after this door is one zombie, who we will call Sleepy Santiago. He is mostly inactive whenever we pass around him, so we ignore him for now. Run past him, then pick up the Golden Arrow.

Zombie waiting to ambush off-frame near the mirror. Carci calls him "The Hallway Humpist". Round the corner, aggroing him, then bait a lunge. If he doesn't lunge, his lunge is on a delay, so you must do an alternative dodge. Let him walk to you for a couple of steps, then run around him using the alt-control movement. Reset if bitten.

### to Main Hall

Go through 2F Dining Room through the double doors to the Main Hall. Avoid the dagger. This dagger is an optional pickup later, but if you must pick it up, picking it up now will result in IRL timeloss if you must reset.

### to Graveyard

Go down the short stairs, through the door to graveyard.

### !!FUCKFACE FREDDY!!

There's two zombies in the graveyard area. The first one, at the base of the stairs, is called Fuckface Freddy. His friend in the left-hand alcove is Fat Fuck Fernando. Fuckface Freddy has many different places he can be, as his set 'rotation value' is completely random. Stairskate down the stairs until you see Fuckface Freddy. Then run past him and head toward the tomb with archer statue. On the way to the Archer Statue, stay to the right hand side of the pathway so Fat Fuck Fernando doesn't aggro. Fat Fuck Fernando will rarely aggro if you stay toward the right hand side, but sometimes he'll aggro. Examine Golden Arrow to get Arrowhead. Use the Arrowhead on the Crypt to gain access. Stairskate down the stairs. When in the crypt, pick up the Book of Curse. Stairskate back up the stairs and leave. If you didn't aggro Fat Fuck Fernando, he'll still remain at his spawn, and you'll only have to dodge Fuckface Freddy. If you see Fuckface Freddy on the sideways camera angle on the way out, try to bait a lunge and run around him. If Fuckface Freddy doesn't lunge, wait for him to meander into a wall and run past him. If you don't see Fuckface Freddy on the sideways camera angle, advance to the next camera angle and backstep into the previous camera angle to ascertain his position. If you have space to just run past, just do that. The ideal setup is if Fuckface Freddy is completely out of your path, and you can just run a straight line back out the door. But if Fat Fuck Fernando is active, you have to dodge them both. Reset the run if you get bit. Otherwise, if you are able and manage to clear both zombies in any situation, stairskate back up the stairs and leave through the door you came through, back into the Main Hall.

### to Art Room

In the main hall, go into your inventory and examine the Book of Curse. Hold Down-Right on the D-pad to rotate the book until you see the Sword Key on the back of it. Holding Down-Right on the D-Pad is the fastest way to rotate the book until you see the Sword Key. Hit "Confirm" to take the Sword Key. Mash Cancel until you regain control of Jill. Stairskate down the stairs then take the double-doors on the right-hand side of the Main Hall, into the Art Gallery with the statue of the Woman Drawing Water.

### Unlock Door

In the Art Gallery ("Art Room") with the Statue of Woman Drawing Water, unlock the Sword Key door and enter the Dog Hallway

### Dog Hallway

Pass through to the door on the opposite side of the hall into the "Squiggle Hall".

### Lockpick Door

Carci calls this hallway the "Squiggle Hall" because it's shaped like a weird squiggle with 4 turns. There are 4 doors. The first door immediately next to the dog hallway (which we just came from), leads to the outside area with two dogs outside of a fence, where you find the Herbicide. This door is locked with the Small Key (Chris) or Lockpick (Jill). The next door is the bathroom with the zombie in the bathtub. The door after that leads to the Shotgun trap. The double-doors at the end of the hall lead to the Spencer Hallway, which will be defined in the "to Spencer Hallway" split. Unlock the first door with the lockpick and enter it.

### Herbicide

This exterior area is a fenced in dead-end with a small boiler and some gardening supplies. There are two zombie dogs outside, which will not jump over the fence unless you exit and return to the room. Run to the Herbicide, pick it up, then leave the room through the same door you entered, back into the Squiggle Hallway.

### to Spencer Hallway

In the squiggle hallway go through the very last set of double-doors, which lead to the Squiggle Hallway.

### to East Stairwell

The Spencer Hallway has 4 doors. The first door leads to the East Stairwell. The second door is locked with a door that has a Spencer Emblem, which is unlocked by the Spencer Key. This door is unlocked much later in the run. The third door is locked by the Armor Key, which leads to the Glass Stain Crow Puzzle. The fourth door leads to the area that leads to the courtyard, the sheltered area where you place the Stone and Metal Object later. Run immediately through the first door to the East Stairwell.

### !!Lunge Bait (Reset)!!

The East Stairwell has 2 floors, 3 zombies, and 6 doors total. Some of these doors will be defined later since they are unimportant at this point in the speedrun. On the first floor, there is one zombie at the bottom of the stairs, next to the East Save Room. Avoid this zombie and avoid going to the East Save Room and stairskate directly up the stairs. Immediately head to Jill's subjective right, which would be the "down" direction on the camera angle at the top of the stairs. This leads toward a door adjacent to a small corridor with another door on the end. 

There is a zombie next to two of the doors on the next camera angle. The first door you see on this camera is missing a doorknob on this side of the door, so it cannot be entered. This door is a one-way door coming from the Small Library. The zombie is closest to this door, around the corner leading into the small corridor. This zombie has a high chance of lunging. Run to the corner to bait a lunge, then use Alt Controls with the left analog stick to swerve downward around him, barely out of his lunge range, then run to the door directly behind him. This door locks from one side, unlocking from the East Stairwell side of the door, to the C-Shaped Hallway. Go through the door.

### !!5% FRANKIE!!

Now we're in the C-Shaped hallway. You'll see the Wooden Mount next to the door you just entered from. DO NOT PICK IT UP. It's useless. There are 5 total doors in this room. They will all be defined in the split titled "Loose Larry". Directly to Jill's subjective right is a door at the end of the hallway. We want to go through that door, but there's one zombie in the way, which you will see immediately This zombie is called "5% Frankie" because he has a 5% chance to grab you. In order to get around him, simply run to the left hand side and hug the wall to get around him. Then you can enter the door to the Small Library (also called the Small Study).

### Lighter, Dog Whistle

Entering the Small Library (also called "Small Study"). There's two doors. The door you enter from is from the C-Shaped Hallway, the other door leads to the East Staiwell. On the other side of that door is the door leading to the second floor of the East Hallway, next to where we dodged a zombie earlier. If you remember, this door mentioned before is a one-way door. You can pass through it and not be able to come back through, so do NOT go through this door. There's a circulation desk directly in front of the door you came in from, with a Lighter on top. Pick up the Lighter. Then turn around immediately and go to the side table next to the door you came from. There is a Dog Whistle sitting on top of this table. Pick it up, then mash out of the following file screen that pops up. Now leave back through the door you came through.

### !!LOOSE LARRY!!

On the way back out from the Small Study, run past 5% Frankie and the door to the East Stairwell. There is a Wooden Mount. Do not pick up the Wooden Mount. After turning the corner, another zombie, which Carci calls "Loose Larry", whose spawn position is next to the locked double doors in the middle of the C-shaped corridor. If you take the corner loosely, hugging the outside wall, you can trigger the next camera angle at a safe angle of approach which will show where Loose Larry will be. Otherwise, you have to blind dodge him. There will be another set of locked doors to pass, and the door at the end of the hall can be opened by the Sword Key. Use the Sword Key to unlock that door and go into the Main Hall.

### Cross to 2F Dining

Because we don't trigger the Shotgun Trap (Jill Sandwich Cutscene) and we don't go to the East Save Room, Barry is not in the main hall. We do not receive acid rounds. We do not need the acid rounds anyway. Go across the walkway to the 2nd Floor Dining Hall.

### Unlock Door

In the 2F Dining Room, unlock the Sword Key Door. Optionally, you can pick up the Dagger in here, which was mentioned before. Enter it to go into West Stairwell 2.

### Lockpick Door

You've entered West Stairwell 2. Directly next to the door you just came in from, from 2F Dining Room, is a door to the West Terrace. Unlock it with your lockpick and go through it.

### !!QS Dogs (Reset)!!

You're on the West Terrace. Equip the Handgun (Slot 1). Use the Dog Whistle (Slot 6). 2 dogs will spawn at the far end of the terrace. You will hear dogs panting, then you will hear a chain dragging. After about 1 second after you hear the chain dragging, try to quickshot. If you can not chain quickshots, fire 3 shots then wait for the approaching dog, "Toby", to throw its head up. When it throws its head up, it's using a grab attack. Shoot the dog one more time when it throws its head up, so that the attack is cancelled. If the dog is far enough, it will then tackle Jill, knock her down, and try to rip out her throat. This attack on its own does no damage, but it can kill you if you don't mash buttons. You can counter this attack with a dagger. If you've done 4 shots worth of damage with the handgun to the dog, then the dagger should kill the dog. Otherwise, shoot one more time. Pick up the collar the dog drops before the second dog runs in to grab you or attack you. Open the inventory, unequip the handgun, then exit through the door you came in from. The game asks if you wish to discard the Dog Whistle since it is no longer useful. Say "Yes" to discard the Dog Whistle.

### !!GRABBY GABRIEL!!

When you re-enter the West Stairwell 2, run around the staircase towards the other side of the 2F level of the stairwell. There is a door locked with the Helmet Key, and a door which unlocks into the Murder Hall (Arrow Hall). In front of this door is a zombie called Grabby Gabriel. Grabby Gabriel sometimes has a high lunge timer, so you may not be able to bait a lunge very quickly. When you bait the lunge, run around him, and unlock the door to the Murder Hall.

### to Key Trap

The door from the West Stairwell is very close to the door to the door to the Armor Trap Hallway. As you go to the Armor Trap Hallway, the dead body rises and becomes a Crimson Head zombie. Ignore him and go through the door to the Armor Trap Hallway.

### Armor Key

Stairskate up the stairs, and proceed through the hallway until you find the Armor Key on an inset on the floor. Take it. This activates a trap, where you have 10 seconds to either put the key back into the inset or put a suitable replacement in the inset, or the trap kills you. Open the inventory, then examine the Dog Collar we picked up before. Press "confirm" to open it. A "coin" will come out of the collar. Then rotate the coin to find the same emblem on the Armor Key. Examine that, and the coin turns into the shape of a key, becoming the Fake Armor Key. Now replace the Armor Key with the Fake Armor Key. The other door at the end of the hall is locked and has a Helmet Key Emblem, which we can't open until later, so turn around and head back to main hall 2F.

### !!Murder Hall!!

We're back in the Arrow Hallway, and now that the Crimson Head has awakened, it is now called the Murder Hall. It is called Murder Hall by speedrunners because many speedrun attempts end here. It is very easy to take so much damage here that you'll get thrown into Orange Caution status, so Carci employs a possible backup strategy here.

Round the corner towards the door to West Stairwell 2. The Crimson Head will be right behind you. Sleepy Santiago, who we normally ignore, has a chance of being in your way now. If Santiago is directly in your path, don't try to bait a lunge, because the Crimson Head will hit you. Instead, go into the West Stairwell 2 door and go out to reset his position. Upon reloading the room from that door (or if you pass Sleepy Santiago) we can run towards the Hallway Humpist, and dodge him the same way we did before. Now we exit through the door that leads to Dining Room 2F.

### to Main Hall

In Dining Room 2F from Murder Hall, Return to main hall.

### to Terrace

in Main Hall 2F, turn right then stairskate up the small steps. There's a locked door which would lead to the 2F terrace, but we will never unlock that door. There's no reason to. Cut across the walkway next to the door to reach a door which you unlock with the Armor Key. This leads to the Terrace which has Forest's body.

### Grenade Launcher

Follow the path all the way to Forest's Body. A cutscene plays here because we didn't trigger Barry's appearance in the Main Hall. In this cutscene, Barry talks to Jill about Forest's demise, then gives her the Grenade Launcher that Forest was holding. Optionally, you may pick up the Dagger on the bench if you don't feel confident with your zombie dodging, but it isn't necessary. Return to the Main Hall through the only door.

### to 2F E Hall

Go down the short stairs next to the door you came out of, to return to the C-Shaped Hallway.

### to Richard

In the C-Shaped Hallway, go though to the first door on the right, and unlock it with the Armor Key. This leads to the Richard Corridor, where Richard is.

### Richard Cutscene

Upon entering this room from the C-Shaped Hallway, a cutscene plays where STARS Bravo Team member Richard Aiken has been bitten by a huge snake and is poisoned by snake venom. Skip it, then the game will send you back out into the C-Shaped Corridor.

### to Main Hall

A map screen will pop up telling you to go to the West Save Room (also known as the "Infirmary"). Mash out of it. You now have 4 minutes to save Richard by picking up some Serum from the Infirmary and bringing it back to Richard. It is faster to save Richard than it is to let him die. Richard must either be saved, or he must die in order to proceed through the door beyond the Richard Corridor, but it is faster to SAVE Richard. Saving Richard does not have any influence on the ending whatsoever, and anywhere you heard that is completely 100% wrong, because I am Carcinogen and I am correct when it comes to Resident Evil REmake. Proceed back through the door to the Main Hall.

### to 2F Dining Room

Go directly across the walkway to the 2F Dining Room.

### to W Stairwell 2

Proceed through the door to West Stairwell 2.

### !!EMESIS EDDIE!!

Upon enteringthe West Stairwell 2 from 2F Dining Room, a zombie is trying to open the door from the terrace that we fought the dogs and picked up the collar previously. Currently in this room, there's two zombies. There's Grabby Gabriel, who we don't even see this trip, and another zombie who may be on the staircase. Circle around to the staircase. When you approach the staircase, this triggers the zombie to bust in from the West Terrace. Ignore him and proceed down the stairs. The next zombie, Emesis Eddie, may either be on the stairs or at the bottom of the stairs. Ideally, we want him to be ON the stairs, because if he's on the stairs, we can stairskate past him, since he will try to puke on us and miss. Zombies puke when they're on the stairs, and while they're puking, they are easy to get around. If Emesis Eddie is at the bottom of the stairs instead, slow down, check his position, and dodge around him to get to the West Save Room (Infirmary). He may be at an awkward angle at the bottom of the stairs, so he may grab us and bite us. Proceed through the door to the West Save Room.

### Deposit HG, Knife, Sword Key

Medical Supply save room. Take the Serum. Deposit the Handgun, Knife, and Sword Key into the item box. Leave back into the West Stairwell.

### Unlock Door

We're on the first floor of West Stairwell 2. Round the corner, then proceed to the end of the corridor (do not go back upstairs). A zombie is in our way, he is very tricky to dodge. Once you get past him there are two doors. One door can be opened with a lockpick. The door next to it can be opened with the Armor Key. Unlock it with the Armor Key, to proceed to the F-Shaped Hallway.

### to Plant Room

From the West Stairwell 2, we are now in the F-Shaped hallway. Pick up the Battery Pack for the Stun Gun. Next, proceed to the end of the hall, where you will enter the Greenhouse through the door.

### Death Mask 1

Coming from the F-Shaped Hallway, go to the pump and use the Herbicide on the pump. Then turn the valve to Red. A cutscene will play where the large plant in the middle of the room will die. Next, pick up the Death Mask behind the now-dead plant, and leave the room through the door you just came in from, to the F-Shaped Hallway.

### to Kenneth Hall

Leaving the Greenhouse, proceed to the other end of the hall. There are 3 more doors. Unlock the door at the end of this branch of the hallway, to get to the Kenneth Hallway. In the Kenneth Hallway, proceed to the Dining Room.

### to Main Hall

From the Kenneth Hallway, you are now in the Dining Room. Grab the Wooden Emblem. Go to the Main Hall.

### to 2F E Hall

From the Dining Room, you are now in the Main Hall. Stairskate up the stairs to get to the 2F C-Shaped Hallway. Go through the door to the C-Shaped Hallway.

### to Richard

From the Main Hall, you are now in the 2F C-Shaped Hallway. Go through the door to the Richard Hallway.


### Richard Serum Cutscene
From the 2F C-Shaped Hallway, you are now in the Richard Hallway. As soon as you run forward, a cutscene plays where you give the serum to Richard. Skip the cutscene. As soon as the cutscene is skipped, turn around immediately and enter the door on the other side of the hallway, which is now open. You will be in the T-Shaped Hallway.


### !!Sleeper!!

In the T-Shaped Hallway, there's one zombie and two doors. One door directly in front leads to the Yawn Boss Room, but it's locked with a Shield Emblem. Go towards the other door, the zombie is in your way. Bait out a lunge and dodge him. On rare occasions, you can simply run past him. Go through the door into the Tea Room.

### !!Music Notes Lunge!!

In the Tea Room room, there's an unlit candle you have to light with the Lighter. If you followed the route correctly, the Lighter will be in Slot 1. Open inventory, use Lighter. The Zombie from the previous room will bust open the door. On the right side of the camera angle, there's a pushable shelf. Push it twice. While you are pushing the shelf, pay attention to where the zombie from the previous room is shambling, so you know which direction to exit. Go into the alcove. Another zombie appears on the camera angle change. Bait a lunge, run behind him, pick up the Musical Score from the shelf. If the zombie spins around, press down on the analog stick and use a defense item. Leave the room through the only door, avoiding the zombie that came in.

### to Richard

Back in the T-Shaped Hallway, go through the door to the Richard Hallway.

### to 2F E Hall

You are now in the Richard Hallway. Go to the C-Shaped Hallway.

### to Kenneth Hall

You are now in the 1F Dining Room via 1F Main Hall. Run to the Kenneth Hallway through the door.

### !!Dodge with Stick Only!!

You are now in the Kenneth Hallway from the Dining Room. Go to the end of the hall to the door locked by an Armor Emblem. There is a zombie in the way. Run up to him then tap back until he lunges. Then run past him, unlock the Armor Key door, and go into the Piano Room.

### Gold Emblem

You are now in the Piano Room. Push the shelf behind the piano (once) to find Moonlight Sonata cover. Run to the front of the piano. Combine the Moonlight Sonata Cover (Slot 7) with the Sheet Music (Slot 6), then Use, to play the piano. Skip the cutscene. The wall opens to a secret passage. Grab Gold Emblem, then the door will close behind you. Use the Wooden Emblem to re-open the door. Leave through the door you came in, back to the Kenneth Hallway.

### !!MAY BACK GRAB!!

In the Kenneth Hallway, run to the Dining Room. There's a 3% chance the zombie may grab you from behind when returning.

### Shield Key

You are now in the Dining Room from the Kenneth Hallway. Put Gold Emblem above fireplace. Go to grandfather clock and solve the puzzle. Move the Large gear twice to the left. This moves the clock and reveals the Shield Key. Get the Shield Key. Return to the Main Hall.

### to 2F E Hall

You are now in the 1F Main Hall from the Dining Room. Stairskate up the stairs from 1F to 2F and go through the door to the C-Shaped Hallway on the East side.

### Death Mask 2 !!YAWN 1!!

You are now in the Yawn Boss Room. Run towards the Mask on the other side of the room. Yawn, the Giant Snake appears. Skip an additional cutscene where Richard enters the room. When you regain control of Jill, hold Up on the D-Pad and nudge left to run past Yawn's head. Pick up the 2nd Death Mask (Death Mask 2). Check Yawn's position. If Richard stuns Yawn, you can run past Yawn's left side to get to the door. Leave the room through the door.

**IF YOU GET BIT, YOUR PERSONAL BEST RUN IS OVER BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A SEMI-PERMANENT SPECIAL YAWN POISON STATUS THAT WILL FORCE YOU TO GO TO THE 1F WEST SAVE ROOM (INFIRMARY) TO GET SERUM. THAT COSTS 2 MINUTES. IN A MARATHON RUN THIS DOES NOT MATTER, BUT IT IS MAJOR ENOUGH TO RUIN ANY PB**

### NOOOOOOOOO

You are now in the T-Shaped Hallway from the Yawn Boss Room. Richard screams as Yawn eats him alive. Leave to the Richard Hallway.

### !!ZOMBIE HERE NOW!!

You are in the Richard Hallway. Now that Richard is no longer in this room (or in this context, dead) there is a zombie here now. You can cut across to avoid him. Leave through the door to the C-Shaped Hallway.

### !!QUICK ROTATION!!

You are now in the C-Shaped Hallway on 2F. Rush to the double-doors in the center of the hallway. On your way over, Loose Larry may get in our way. We have to blind dodge him again, because we will have no idea where he is, based on the camera angles. Just run the straightest line you can with tank controls and hopefully he won't grab you. If he does, then either take the bite or use a defense item. There's nothing you can do about this if it happens besides use a defense item. Go to the double doors, unlock them with the Armor key, then enter the Armor Puzzle Room.

### Death Mask 3

You are now in the Armor Puzzle Room. Push the Top-Right,Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right statues in that order. Then press the button in the center of the room, then pick up the Jewelry Box. Leave back into the C-Shaped Hallway via the door you came in through (which is the only door).

### to 2F E Stairs
