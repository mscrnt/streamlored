# Classic Resident Evil Mainline Games

## Overview

The classic mainline Resident Evil games (before RE4's action shift) define survival horror for many players. These are the "Carci-core" games – the ones that get run, routed, and dissected on stream.

## The Games

### Resident Evil Zero (2002)
Prequel set on a train and training facility the night before RE1. Rebecca Chambers teams up with convict Billy Coen. Notable for the partner zapping system (switching between characters) and no item boxes – you drop items on the ground. Divisive among fans: some love the expanded lore, others find it tedious and poorly paced.

**Stream appeal:** Partner management adds complexity. Item drop system creates unique routing challenges. Generally considered harder than other classic entries.

### Resident Evil / REmake (1996/2002)
The Spencer Mansion incident. S.T.A.R.S. members investigate disappearances in the Arklay Mountains and find zombies, monsters, and Umbrella's secrets. The 2002 GameCube remake is the definitive version – gorgeous pre-rendered backgrounds, expanded areas, and Crimson Heads (zombies that come back stronger if not burned).

**Stream appeal:** The gold standard. Deep routing for speedruns, rank runs, knife-only runs, and other challenges. REmake is mechanically tight and endlessly replayable.

### Resident Evil 2 (1998)
Leon Kennedy's first day as a Raccoon City cop coincides with the zombie outbreak. Claire Redfield searches for her brother Chris. Two characters, two scenarios (A/B), four total playthroughs with variations. The police station is iconic level design.

**Stream appeal:** Multiple scenarios create variety. Tight pacing and good difficulty curve. Leon A/Claire B vs Claire A/Leon B routing discussions.

### Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999)
Jill Valentine escapes Raccoon City while being hunted by Nemesis, a Tyrant programmed to kill S.T.A.R.S. members. More action-oriented than RE2 with dodging mechanics and the persistent Nemesis threat. Shorter but intense.

**Stream appeal:** Nemesis encounters add unpredictability. Dodge mechanic rewards skill. Speedruns are fast and aggressive.

### Resident Evil Code: Veronica (2000)
Claire is captured by Umbrella and sent to Rockfort Island, then escapes to Antarctica. Chris eventually joins the story. Longer and harder than previous entries, with some notoriously punishing sections (the Tyrant plane fight, the moth hallway).

**Stream appeal:** Challenge runs are brutal. CV is considered one of the hardest classic REs. Resource management is tight throughout.

## Why These Are "Carci-Core"

These games reward:

### Deep Mechanical Knowledge
Understanding exact damage values, enemy behavior patterns, RNG manipulation, and optimal routing separates casual play from high-level execution.

### Challenge Runs
- **Knife only** – Beat the game using only the knife
- **No damage** – Complete without taking any hits
- **No save** – One continuous run with no safety net
- **Rank runs** – Achieve S-rank or best ending conditions
- **Speedruns** – Optimized routing and execution for time

### Routing Optimization
The fixed structure of these games (set items, set enemies, set events) makes routing a deep puzzle. Finding the fastest path, the safest path, or the most resource-efficient path is endlessly analyzable.

### Replayability
Tight 2-3 hour runtimes (once you know what you're doing) make these ideal for repeated plays. You can run RE2 or REmake dozens of times and still find optimizations.

## Shared Design Elements

### Item Boxes
Universal storage accessible from any box. Inventory management puzzle.

### Save Rooms
Safe spaces with save points (typewriters) and often item boxes. The music is iconic.

### Ink Ribbons
Consumable save items in most classic entries. Adds stakes to saving.

### Limited Inventory
4-8 slots depending on the game and character. Forces constant decision-making.

### Backtracking
You'll cross the same areas multiple times as you unlock doors and complete objectives. Learning the maps is essential.
