# Resident Evil Spinoffs and Oddities

## Overview

Beyond the mainline games, Capcom has thrown a lot of experiments at the wall. Some worked, some didn't, but they're all interesting for different reasons.

## Outbreak Series

### Resident Evil Outbreak (2003)
### Resident Evil Outbreak File #2 (2004)

Online multiplayer survival horror set during the Raccoon City outbreak. You play as civilians trying to escape various scenarios with up to four players (or AI companions).

**What makes them interesting:**
- Multiplayer survival horror years before it became common
- Multiple playable characters with unique abilities
- Scenarios are self-contained episodes, not one continuous story
- Infection meter – you're always slowly turning and need to find anti-virus

**Why they're remembered:**
- Ahead of their time – the infrastructure for online PS2 gaming wasn't ready
- Genuinely tense co-op experience
- Fans have kept them alive through private servers

**Stream appeal:** Outbreak is great with friends but rough solo due to AI. The infection timer adds constant pressure. Scenarios are varied and replayable.

## Gun Survivor Series

### Resident Evil Survivor (2000)
First-person light gun shooter (playable with controller). You're an amnesiac on Sheena Island during an outbreak. Widely considered mediocre – it's not scary, the shooting is clunky, and the story is forgettable.

### Resident Evil: Dead Aim (2003)
Third-person exploration with first-person shooting. Set on a cruise ship with a bioterror attack. Better than Survivor but still not great. Has its defenders for the atmosphere and some decent monster designs.

**Why they exist:** Capcom experimenting with the light gun genre during its brief popularity. They're historical curiosities more than good games.

## Chronicles Series

### Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles (2007)
### Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles (2009)

Wii rail shooters that retell events from the mainline games with new content filling gaps. UC covers RE0, RE1, and RE3 plus new Umbrella's fall content. DC covers RE2 and Code Veronica plus new South American operations.

**What makes them interesting:**
- Actually fun rail shooters with solid production values
- Fill in lore gaps and expand on background events
- Two-player co-op

**Stream appeal:** They're breezy, they look good for Wii games, and they're easy to follow for viewers.

## Other Oddities

### Resident Evil Gaiden (2001)
Game Boy Color game where Barry Burton investigates a cruise ship. Turn-based combat with timing minigame for attacks. It's weird and non-canon.

### Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City (2012)
Squad-based shooter where you play as Umbrella operatives during the RE2/3 timeframe. Panned for poor execution – bad AI, generic gameplay, and a campaign that doesn't do anything interesting with the premise.

### Umbrella Corps (2016)
Competitive multiplayer shooter. Virtually dead on arrival. Nobody asked for this, and nobody played it.

### Resident Evil: Resistance (2020)
Asymmetric multiplayer bundled with RE3R. One player as mastermind setting traps, four as survivors. Had some fans but largely overshadowed by RE3R criticism and abandoned fairly quickly.

## Why These Matter for Streams

**Outbreak:** Genuine hidden gem, especially with friends. Worth showing people what Capcom was doing with multiplayer horror in 2003.

**Survivor/Dead Aim:** Jank content. Fun to laugh at, not fun to play seriously.

**Chronicles:** Solid palette cleanser. Easy to pick up, looks nice, tells familiar stories from new angles.

**The bad ones:** Good for "Capcom's worst ideas" streams but not much else.

## The Lesson

Capcom has always been willing to experiment with RE. Sometimes you get Outbreak (ahead of its time), sometimes you get Umbrella Corps (why did this exist?). The mainline quality is consistent, but spinoffs are always a gamble.
