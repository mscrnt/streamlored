# Dino Crisis Series and Remake Copium

## What Is Dino Crisis?

Dino Crisis is Capcom's survival horror series featuring dinosaurs instead of zombies. Directed by Shinji Mikami (Resident Evil creator), it uses similar fixed-camera, tank-control gameplay but with faster, more aggressive enemies that require different strategies.

## The Games

### Dino Crisis (1999)
Regina and her team infiltrate a research facility on Ibis Island to extract a scientist, only to find it overrun by dinosaurs created through time-displacement experiments. The game emphasizes evasion over combat – raptors are fast and deadly, and ammo is scarce. Puzzles involve rerouting power and accessing different facility areas.

### Dino Crisis 2 (2000)
Shifts to action-horror with a combo system, more weapons, and points for kills. Regina and a new character, Dylan, travel to a future where dinosaurs have overrun the world. Faster-paced and more arcade-like than the first game. Generally well-received but a significant tone shift.

### Dino Crisis 3 (2003)
Set on a spaceship with mutant dinosaurs. Xbox exclusive. Largely considered a disappointment with bad camera controls and a generic sci-fi setting that lost what made the series interesting. This effectively killed the franchise.

## Why It's Called "Resident Evil but Dinosaurs"

Because that's basically what it is:
- Same engine and control scheme as RE
- Similar puzzle-heavy exploration
- Resource management and limited saves
- Capcom reusing what worked

The key difference is enemy behavior – dinosaurs are faster and smarter than zombies, requiring more evasion and careful engagement.

## Why Fans Want a Remake

### Nostalgia and Quality
The first game is genuinely good survival horror that's been largely forgotten. Fans want it preserved and modernized.

### RE Engine Potential
Capcom's RE Engine would be perfect for Dino Crisis. Imagine the RE2 Remake treatment applied to raptors hunting you through a facility.

### Underserved Niche
There aren't many dinosaur horror games. A Dino Crisis remake would have limited competition.

### Capcom Knows
Capcom has acknowledged fan demand multiple times. They're clearly aware people want it.

## Why a Remake Hasn't Happened (Yet)

### Lower Sales Than RE
Dino Crisis sold well but never reached Resident Evil numbers. The sequels sold progressively less. From a business perspective, it's riskier than another RE remake.

### Capcom's Dev Capacity
Capcom can only make so many games at once. RE4 Remake, RE9, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter – there's a queue, and Dino Crisis isn't at the front.

### Risk vs Established Hits
Why gamble on reviving a dormant franchise when RE remakes are guaranteed sellers? Dino Crisis would need to prove itself again.

### Brand Rebuilding Required
The series ended badly with DC3. A remake would need to rebuild trust and interest from scratch, unlike RE which never stopped being relevant.

## Stock Answers for "Dino Crisis Remake When?"

### The Realistic One
"Capcom knows fans want it. Whether they think it's worth the investment over more RE content is the question. It could happen, but there's been no announcement and no credible leaks."

### The Cautiously Optimistic One
"It's more likely than a lot of fan requests – Capcom has the engine, the experience, and they've acknowledged the demand. But 'more likely than most' still isn't 'confirmed.' Don't hold your breath, but don't give up hope either."

### The Pragmatic One
"Best case: RE remakes keep selling, Capcom runs out of mainline RE games to remake, and Dino Crisis is next in line. Worst case: it stays dormant forever because the numbers never justify it. We're somewhere in between."
