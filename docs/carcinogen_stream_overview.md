* **Resident Evil** – _Resident Evil_ is a long-running survival horror series from Capcom that revolutionized the genre with its focus on atmospheric tension, limited resources, and encounters with bioengineered monstrosities. Beginning in 1996, the franchise follows characters like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Leon S. Kennedy, and Claire Redfield as they battle viral outbreaks created by the Umbrella Corporation and other bioterror groups, leading to global-scale catastrophes. The series is known for reinventing itself—transitioning from fixed-camera survival horror to action-oriented gameplay and later to first-person psychological horror—while maintaining themes of corporate conspiracy, science gone wrong, and human resilience. Spanning dozens of games, films, novels, and animated features, _Resident Evil_ remains one of gaming’s most influential and commercially successful horror franchises.
  
* **Castlevania** – _Castlevania_ is a gothic action-adventure series by Konami that centers on the centuries-long conflict between the heroic Belmont clan and the immortal vampire lord Dracula. Debuting in 1986, the franchise became known for its challenging platforming, atmospheric horror aesthetics, and iconic music. Early games focused on linear, whip-based action, while later titles—most notably _Symphony of the Night_—helped pioneer the “Metroidvania” formula, emphasizing open exploration, RPG mechanics, and nonlinear progression. Spanning dozens of entries, reboots, and adaptations—including a popular animated series—_Castlevania_ remains a cornerstone of dark fantasy gaming, blending monster-hunting lore with evolving gameplay innovations.
  
* **Silent Hill** – _Silent Hill_ is a psychological horror series from Konami known for its unsettling atmosphere, symbolic storytelling, and emphasis on psychological terror over jump scares. Debuting in 1999, the franchise follows various protagonists drawn to or trapped within the fog-shrouded town of Silent Hill, a place where personal trauma manifests as nightmarish creatures and shifting realities. The early Team Silent titles are celebrated for their mature themes, oppressive sound design, and haunting music by Akira Yamaoka. Over time, the series expanded through sequels, reimaginings, films, and spin-offs, earning a reputation as one of the most influential and artistically ambitious horror franchises in gaming.
  
* **Metal Gear Solid** – Once the premiere Stealth Action franchises. _Metal Gear_ is a stealth-action series created by Hideo Kojima and published by Konami, famous for its cinematic storytelling, political intrigue, and innovative emphasis on avoiding direct combat. Beginning in 1987, the franchise follows supersoldier Solid Snake—and later characters like Big Boss, Raiden, and Venom Snake—through decades-spanning conflicts involving nuclear-armed mechs known as Metal Gears, shadowy military organizations, and complex themes about war, identity, and information control. Known for blending tactical gameplay with long, narrative-driven cutscenes, fourth-wall breaks, and philosophical undertones, the _Metal Gear_ series has grown into one of gaming’s most influential and stylistically distinctive sagas.
  
* **Dino Crisis** – _Dino Crisis_ is a survival horror series created by Capcom that blends the tension and resource management of classic _Resident Evil_ with fast, unpredictable dinosaur encounters. Debuting in 1999, the franchise follows special agents—most notably Regina—as they investigate research facilities where experimental energy technology has triggered time-distortion events, unleashing deadly prehistoric creatures. Known for its real-time environments, puzzle-solving, and high-intensity combat against intelligent, aggressive dinosaurs, the series delivered a unique sci-fi horror flavor across its early entries before shifting toward action in later installments. Though dormant for years, _Dino Crisis_ remains a cult favorite remembered for its thrilling mix of science-gone-wrong and Jurassic terror.
  
* **Dead Space** – The _Dead Space_ series is a sci-fi survival horror franchise centered on engineer Isaac Clarke as he battles grotesque reanimated creatures called Necromorphs, spawned by alien artifacts known as Markers that drive humans insane and reshape their bodies. Blending atmospheric dread with strategic dismemberment-focused combat, the series follows Isaac from the doomed mining ship USG _Ishimura_ to derelict stations, icy colonies, and cult-controlled facilities as he uncovers the truth behind the Markers, Unitology (the fanatical religion surrounding them), and his own deteriorating psyche. Across its main trilogy and spin-offs, _Dead Space_ stands out for oppressive environments, body horror, and a narrative that mixes cosmic mystery with personal tragedy.
  
* **Clock Tower** – The _Clock Tower_ series is a classic survival horror franchise known for its slow-burn tension, focus on vulnerability, and iconic stalker enemies—especially the relentless Scissorman. Beginning with the 1995 Super Famicom original, the games center on defenseless protagonists (often young women) who must explore eerie mansions, schools, and towns while solving puzzles and avoiding murderous pursuers rather than fighting them. Each entry emphasizes multiple endings, point-and-click or adventure-style exploration, and the constant threat of a stalker who can appear unexpectedly, creating a uniquely anxiety-driven atmosphere. Though the timeline and protagonists shift across sequels, the series’ identity remains rooted in dread, suspense, and the feeling of being hunted.
  
* **Parasite Eve** – The _Parasite Eve_ series blends survival horror with RPG mechanics, following NYPD officer Aya Brea as she confronts a biological nightmare rooted in mitochondria that have evolved into sentient, mutagenic forces. The first game, set during a catastrophic Christmas in New York, mixes cinematic storytelling with semi-real-time combat as Aya battles creatures born from humanity’s own cells rebelling against their hosts. _Parasite Eve II_ shifts toward more traditional survival-horror gameplay, while _The 3rd Birthday_ reimagines the formula with action-oriented mechanics and a time-warping narrative. Across the series, themes of identity, evolution, and body horror are central, making _Parasite Eve_ a distinctive fusion of science fiction, horror, and character-driven drama.

Later prequels follow Adam Jensen as he navigates a world divided by the ethics and power dynamics of augmentation, with gameplay built around multiple solutions to every problem—hacking, persuasion, stealth, or direct confrontation.

## What are the rules for the stream?
- Please try to avoid being openly hostile to other people, and avoid conflict. The block button exists. That is your only line of responsibility for any chat, discord, or comments section run by Carci, and it is preferred that you exercise this as it is your prerogative.
- If religion and politics are discussed (some games are inherently political), do not turn it into a debate, do not smear other peoples' political parties or religions, and do not assert your politics or religion. If I say stop, stop. Don't call people Nazis in my chat unless they're honest-to-god Hitler-supporting Nazis. Absolutely fuck Nazis.
- Racist, Sexist, Homophobic, Transphobic, and Religious smearing: don't do it. Carci acknowledges preferred gender pronouns respectfully. If you do not acknowledge preferred gender pronouns, keep it to yourself. Any asserted hostilities over this rule will create conflict, and Carci does not have the time or energy to deal with this.
- Carci realizes sometimes he slips up on my own rules. We all slip up. Please don't normalize it.
- Atmosphere is paramount. Pretend this is a public establishment, owned by a private entity. I have the right to refuse your presence in my channel for any reason.
