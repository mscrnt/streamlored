# PS1/PS2 Fixed Camera Horror

## What Defines This Style

The PS1 and PS2 era established a specific survival horror template:

### Fixed Camera Angles
Pre-rendered backgrounds with static camera positions. The camera shows you what the designers want you to see, creating tension through limited and controlled perspectives.

### Tank Controls
Press up to move forward relative to your character, not the camera. Clunky by modern standards but creates deliberate, weighty movement that makes combat tense.

### Limited Resources
Ammo, health items, and saves are scarce. You're always slightly under-equipped, which maintains tension throughout the game.

### Save Systems
Typewriters, save rooms, ink ribbons – saving is a resource and a commitment. Modern auto-saves remove this tension entirely.

### Inventory Management
Limited carrying capacity forces choices. Do you bring the shotgun or make room for health items? Inventory tetris becomes part of the gameplay.

## Why This Style Is Beloved

### Intentional Design
Every camera angle is chosen. Horror is crafted shot-by-shot, like a film. Modern over-the-shoulder cameras give players control but lose this curation.

### Tension Through Limitation
Clunky controls aren't a bug – they're a feature. You're not an action hero. You're vulnerable, and the controls reinforce that.

### Atmosphere Over Action
Fixed cameras allow detailed, atmospheric backgrounds. The Resident Evil mansion looks the way it does because of pre-rendered art that wouldn't be possible in real-time 3D of that era.

### Meaningful Choices
When saves are limited and inventory is small, every decision matters. Modern convenience removes these stakes.

## Notable Examples

Beyond the big names (RE, Silent Hill, Dino Crisis), the PS1/PS2 era had:

- **Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare** – Reboot of the grandfather of survival horror
- **Haunting Ground** – Spiritual successor to Clock Tower with a dog companion
- **Rule of Rose** – Controversial, atmospheric, janky combat
- **Kuon** – From Software's pre-Souls horror game
- **Fatal Frame series** – Combat through photographing ghosts
- **Obscure** – Teen horror with co-op
- **Cold Fear** – RE4-style on a ship, often forgotten

## Why Modern Games Moved Away

### Accessibility
Tank controls and fixed cameras have a learning curve. Publishers want broader audiences.

### Technology
Real-time 3D environments got good enough that pre-rendered backgrounds weren't necessary.

### Resident Evil 4
RE4 proved you could make survival horror with modern controls and it would sell massively. Everyone followed.

### Player Expectations
Modern players often bounce off tank controls. "Why can't I just move where I want?" is a common complaint.

## The Nostalgia Factor

People who grew up with these games often prefer them to modern horror:
- The controls feel right because that's how they learned
- The atmosphere of pre-rendered backgrounds is unmatched
- Modern horror often feels like action games with spooky paint

This isn't just rose-tinted glasses – the design philosophy genuinely produces different experiences. But it's also true that you can't go back. New games in this style (like Tormented Souls) exist but remain niche.

## Stream Considerations

Fixed-camera horror streams well because:
- Camera angles are cinematic
- Pacing allows for commentary
- Resource tension creates drama
- Deaths feel consequential

The downside is that tank controls can look awkward to unfamiliar viewers, and backtracking-heavy design can feel slow.
