# Parasite Eve 2 – Remake Reality Check

## What Is Parasite Eve 2?

Parasite Eve 2 is a survival horror RPG by Square (now Square Enix) released on PlayStation in 1999 (JP) / 2000 (NA/EU). It follows Aya Brea dealing with new mitochondrial creature outbreaks, but shifts the series toward more action-focused, Resident Evil–style gameplay with fixed cameras and tank controls.

Unlike the first game's ATB combat system, PE2 plays more like classic RE with real-time shooting, limited inventory, and exploration of interconnected areas. It's considered one of the better PS1 survival horror games outside the Resident Evil and Silent Hill franchises.

## Why Fans Want a PE2 Remake

### Nostalgia Factor
It's a beloved PS1 game from the late 90s horror golden age. People have fond memories of it and want to experience it again with modern graphics and controls.

### Aya Brea
There are very few big-budget horror games starring a woman who isn't just there to scream and die. Aya is a competent protagonist, and fans want to see her return.

### The Remake Precedent
"If Resident Evil and Dead Space got remakes, why not this?" Every successful horror remake makes fans hope their favorite is next.

### Unfinished Business
The series ended awkwardly with The 3rd Birthday on PSP, which most fans pretend doesn't exist. A PE2 remake could be a chance to do the franchise justice.

## What's Actually Happening

- There has **never** been an official announcement of a Parasite Eve 2 remake.
- The series has been dormant since 2010.
- Square Enix has not indicated any plans to revive the franchise.
- No credible leaks or rumors have suggested a remake is in development.

## Why a Remake Is Unlikely

These are the commonly cited reasons a PE2 remake is a long shot:

### IP Complexity
Parasite Eve is based on a Japanese novel by Hideaki Sena. This creates potential licensing complications that don't exist for wholly-owned IPs. Whether this is actually a major obstacle is unclear, but it's frequently mentioned as a concern.

### Brand Strength
Parasite Eve has a cult following, not a mainstream one. It never achieved the sales or cultural penetration of Resident Evil or Final Fantasy. A remake would be targeting a relatively small audience.

### Square Enix Priorities
Square Enix has bigger, safer franchises that get most of the budget and attention:
- Final Fantasy (including VII Remake trilogy)
- Dragon Quest
- Kingdom Hearts

Why take a risk on niche PS1 horror when you can make another guaranteed seller?

### Risk vs Reward
Modern AAA game development is expensive. A full remake of PE2 would cost tens of millions of dollars. For a niche title with uncertain sales potential, that's a hard pitch to make to executives.

### The 3rd Birthday Problem
The last game in the series was poorly received. That's not a great foundation for convincing a publisher to invest in the franchise again.

## Is It Literally Impossible?

No. Things that seem unlikely sometimes happen:
- Dead Space got a remake after EA killed the franchise
- Silent Hill 2 is getting remade by Bloober Team
- Capcom brought back Onimusha for a remaster

But "not impossible" is different from "likely." Without a major strategic shift at Square Enix or renewed interest in the franchise, a PE2 remake is not on the horizon.

## Stock Answers for "PE2 Remake When?"

When chat inevitably asks about a Parasite Eve 2 remake, here are some honest responses:

### The Realistic One
"Probably never. Square Enix has bigger priorities, the series has been dead for over a decade, and there's been zero indication they're interested in reviving it. Hope if you want, but don't expect."

### The Snarky One
"Right after they finish remaking every Final Fantasy twice and run out of Dragon Quest spinoffs. So check back in about 2045."

### The Slightly Hopeful One
"It's not impossible – stranger things have happened – but there's no evidence it's coming. If Square suddenly announces it, I'll be as surprised as you."

### The Practical One
"The best thing fans can do is support any Square Enix horror releases and make noise about wanting it. But realistically, the market for niche PS1 horror remakes is small, and publishers know it."
