# Parasite Eve Series Overview

## What Is Parasite Eve?

Parasite Eve is Square's survival horror RPG series starring Aya Brea, an NYPD officer with mitochondrial powers. The series blends horror atmosphere with RPG mechanics, though the balance shifts significantly between entries.

## The Games

### Parasite Eve (1997)
Aya investigates a series of spontaneous human combustions in New York City, leading to a confrontation with Eve, a being evolved from mitochondria. The gameplay is an ATB (Active Time Battle) system similar to Final Fantasy, with real-time movement during combat. You customize weapons and armor with a unique mod system.

PE1 is more RPG than survival horror – you level up, grind for better gear, and the combat system has depth. The horror comes from atmosphere, body horror imagery, and the unsettling premise rather than resource scarcity or vulnerability.

### Parasite Eve 2 (1999/2000)
Aya, now working for a government anti-mitochondrial agency, investigates new creature outbreaks in the Mojave Desert. The gameplay shifts dramatically – it's now Resident Evil-style survival horror with fixed cameras, tank controls, and real-time shooting. Limited inventory, limited ammo, save points.

PE2 is the game most survival horror fans think of. It's closer to RE than to PE1, and it's generally considered a solid PS1 horror title that deserves more recognition. The separate doc on PE2 remake prospects covers why a remake is unlikely.

### The 3rd Birthday (2010)
Aya loses her memories and gains the ability to possess soldiers through "Overdive." A PSP action game that most fans prefer to ignore. The story is controversial, the tone is off, and it ends on a baffling note that essentially erases Aya's character. Generally considered a low point that damaged the franchise.

## Series Identity Problem

Parasite Eve has an identity crisis:
- PE1 is an RPG with horror themes
- PE2 is survival horror with light RPG elements
- The 3rd Birthday is an action game that happens to have Aya in it

This inconsistency makes it harder to pitch a revival. What would a new Parasite Eve even be?

## Why the Series Matters

### Aya Brea
One of the few horror game protagonists who's a competent adult woman with agency. She's not a victim, not sexualized (until T3B), and not defined by relationships with men.

### PS1 Horror Golden Age
PE2 especially represents the peak of PS1-era survival horror alongside RE and Silent Hill. It's the third pillar that often gets forgotten.

### Unique Premise
Mitochondrial horror is weird and distinctive. It's not zombies, not demons, not aliens – it's your own cells turning against you.

## Remake Prospects

Covered in detail in the Parasite Eve 2 remake reality doc, but the short version: unlikely. The series has been dormant for over a decade, Square Enix has bigger priorities, and The 3rd Birthday left a bad taste. Fans keep asking, but there's no indication Square is listening.

The best hope is probably Square deciding to test the waters with a remaster or port, then gauging interest for something bigger. But even that hasn't happened.
