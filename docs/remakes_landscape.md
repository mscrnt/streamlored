# The Modern Remake Landscape

## The Remake Boom

We're living in the golden age of remakes, remasters, and "definitive editions." Publishers figured out that nostalgia sells, and now every game from the PS1/PS2 era is potentially on the table.

## Why Some Games Get Remakes

### Brand Recognition

The biggest factor. If a game sold millions of copies and people still talk about it 20 years later, it's remake material. Resident Evil 2 sold over 5 million copies originally. That's why it got a remake before, say, Dino Crisis.

### Safe Investment

Remakes are less risky than new IPs. The story exists, and can be adapted to modern game design. The audience exists. You're not gambling on whether people will care – you already know they do.

### Tech Showcase

Remakes let studios show off their current engine and tools. RE Engine looks incredible, and what better way to demonstrate that than rebuilding a beloved classic?

### Franchise Revival

Sometimes a remake is a test balloon. "If this sells well, maybe we'll make a new one." Dead Space remake was partly about seeing if the franchise still had legs.

## Why Most Requested Remakes Never Happen

Here's the part nobody wants to hear: the market doesn't care about your extremely specific PS1 childhood trauma as much as you do.

### Niche Appeal

Your favorite game might be incredible, but if it sold 200,000 copies in 1999, a publisher isn't going to spend $50 million remaking it. The math doesn't work.

### Rights and Licensing

Some games have messy ownership situations. Maybe the original developer is gone. Maybe the IP is split between companies. Maybe it's based on a licensed property that would require renegotiation.

### Opportunity Cost

Every remake a studio makes is a game they're *not* making. If you're Capcom, do you remake Dino Crisis or make Resident Evil 9? One of those is a guaranteed hit.

### The "Who Asked" Factor

Sometimes fans are very loud online but wouldn't actually buy the game. Publishers have seen this play out enough times to be skeptical.

## Examples of the Remake Hierarchy

### Top Tier (Guaranteed remakes)
- Resident Evil 2, 3, 4
- Final Fantasy VII
- Dead Space
- Silent Hill 2

### Mid Tier (Maybe someday)
- Dino Crisis
- Resident Evil Code Veronica
- Legacy of Kain

### Bottom Tier (Probably never)
- Parasite Eve 2
- Onimusha
- Most PS1 horror games you loved as a kid

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Most games that "deserve" remakes will never get them. It's not because publishers are stupid or hate fans. It's because making games is expensive, risky, and time-consuming, and there are only so many projects a studio can do at once.

If your favorite game isn't getting remade, it's usually because:
1. It didn't sell enough originally
2. The rights situation is complicated
3. Something else is a better use of resources

That doesn't mean it's impossible. Just unlikely. And hoping really hard doesn't change the spreadsheet.
